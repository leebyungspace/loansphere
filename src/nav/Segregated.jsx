            In business and banking, transparency and accuracy are vital. When sending payments
            on behalf of your customers, you must ensure that each transaction is carried out
            exactly as intended. Itâ€™s just as important to clearly track incoming payments and
            attribute them correctly.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            To support this, Gatewise offers <strong>segregated accounts</strong> â€” ideal for
            Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and other financial institutions. These accounts ensure
            complete separation of client funds from the bankâ€™s operational assets, giving you
            precise visibility over which funds belong to which clients.
          </p>
